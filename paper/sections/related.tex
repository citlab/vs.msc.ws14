\section{Related Work}
There have been several efforts of using Software-Defined Networking to increase performance of big
data analysis.  Application awareness plays a significant role to estimate traffic demand and
dependencies. In the case of Hadoop, the Hadoop job tracker offers information about placement of
map and reduce tasks, it monitors the progress of all tasks to predict traffic demand for the
network-bound shuffle phase. \cite{programmingatruntime} \cite {pythia} provide ways to program the
network at runtime and avoid hotspots by using these information in combination of network topology
and link-level utilization.

In \cite{query}, Software-Defined Networking is used to optimize distributed analysis queries by
prioritizing network traffics and reserving bandwidths. In addition, they match the query plans
against the network topology. Topology aware task scheduling is also proposed in
\cite{programmingatruntime}.

Our work is focused on the placement of Flink tasks by taking network topology into account. The
algorithm developed could also be used for other frameworks.
