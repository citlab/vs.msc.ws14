\section{Introduction}
This paper deals with optimizing performance of parallel dataflows in \textit{Big Data Analytics}
utilizing \textit{Software Defined Networking} (\textit{SDN}). The significance of Big Data
Analytics software stems from the prevailing need of many businesses to process large volumes of
data. However, many such systems do not consider the topology of the network they are deployed on.

Throughput and processing time of an analytical program running on distributed clusters can be
improved by utilizing knowledge about the underlying network or managing the network devices
dynamically during runtime. We present some approaches and evaluate one of the more promising among
them.

We test if, how and by what margin advantages of SDN-based environments over traditional ones
increase the performance of a specific data processing engine for use in clusters. We adjust the
scheduler of the engine and develop a middleware that communicates with it as well as with our
networkâ€™s control component such that information on the network is delivered to the scheduler on
demand.
