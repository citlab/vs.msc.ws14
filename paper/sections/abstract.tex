It is required to process large amounts of data in an efficient manner in parallel on multiple
nodes. Parallel dataflow frameworks can handle this task but currently lack network awareness.
Further, dynamic networking - so called software defined networking - is arising. To improve the
efficiency of data processing, this paper presents an approach of coupling the Apache Flink data
processing engine with an SDN. Different concepts of scheduling tasks to nodes are introduced and
discussed. Also, a middleware is developed that handles topology adjusted execution job placement
and network-link load balancing for leveraging SDN capabilities, making data processing overall
faster and more efficient. Deployment on a software-based testbed shows performance gains from this
approach.
