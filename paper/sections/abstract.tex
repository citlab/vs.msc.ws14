To process large amounts of data in an efficient manner, execution is often scheduled in parallel on
multiple nodes. Parallel dataflow frameworks can handle this task but its schedulers currently lack
network awareness. Further, dynamic networking, so called \textit{Software-Defined Networking}, is
arising. To improve the efficiency in terms of total execution time of data processing, this paper
presents an approach of coupling the Apache Flink data processing engine with a Software Defined
Network. Different approaches of scheduling tasks to nodes are introduced and discussed. Also, a
middleware is developed that handles topology adjusted execution job placement and network-link load
balancing, leveraging Software-Defined Networking capabilities, making data processing overall
faster and more efficient. Deployment on a software-based testbed shows performance gains from this
approach.
