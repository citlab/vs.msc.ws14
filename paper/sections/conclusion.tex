\section{Conclusion}
Using information about the underlying networkâ€™s topology, we applied intelligent task placement
with weak consideration of physical distances in form of hops, effectively reducing job processing
time by eliminating previously existing redundant transmission effort resulting from more arbitrary
deployment decisions. More intelligent scheduling via traffic monitoring and the possibility of
post-deployment load balancing further validate the utilization of SDN-enabled networks in
conjunction with processing systems for Big Data Analytics.
