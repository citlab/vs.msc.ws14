\section{Conclusion}
Using information about the underlying network, we improved task placement with consideration of
physical distances in form of hops, effectively reducing job processing time by eliminating
previously existing redundant transmission costs resulting from more arbitrary deployment decisions.
More intelligent scheduling via traffic monitoring and the possibility of post-deployment load
balancing further encourage the utilization of SDN-enabled networks in conjunction with processing
systems for Big Data Analytics.

We evaluated a significant overall performance gain by adding the notion of grouped host deployment.
Even though our approach is a general one equivalent solutions in conjunction with alternative
software might not be possible due to the open source nature of our setup components. Nevertheless,
the efficiency improvement of our setup validates some advantages of its components and should
encourage further research of our approach under different circumstances.
